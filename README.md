## Welcome, friend

Here you can find stuff from me thats not published on my Uni Repository

<hr/>

## Who am I?

I am a 20-year-old Israeli-German Computer Science student at the University of Bremen in Germany.

<hr/>

## What can you find here?

All sorts of stuff, from reverse shells to full-on AIs, all provided with documentation and under the MIT License.

<hr/>
## Can I use your tools?

Of course! You may also modify them at will. However any trouble caused by them will be your own problem, not mine! :)

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/leolion3/Portfolio/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/leolion3/Portfolio/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
