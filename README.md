## Can I use your tools?

Of course! You may also modify them at will. However any trouble caused by them will be your own problem, not mine! :)

<hr/>

## Ok I'm in, where are the tools?

Well you can stick around and take a look at the tools below, or you can go browse the repository!

<a href="https://github.com/leolion3/Portfolio/tree/master/Python/PasswordVault"><h2>Python Password Vault</h2></a>

``` 
A full-on password vault using multi-layer AES-256 encryption (in a very chaotically smart way) with an local sqlite database. 
- Never use a password manager ever again :)
