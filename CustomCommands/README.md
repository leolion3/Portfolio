# Custom Windows Commands

This package adds multiple shorter/combined git commands, and some other things as well.

Included are:
- Git command shortcuts for adding files, commits, pushing, checking remote upstreams, git log and more
- Wifi commands for getting current wifi settings
- Password Generator and Password Vault command line commands

To use the tools from the command line, add the folder containing them to your windows PATH. After doing so you may use them from the command line. For example: "c" would execute the c.cmd script. 

### Please note:
- To use the "l.cmd" file properly, please execute (in an administrative command shell) the command included at the end of the l.cmd file. This only needs to be done once.
- To use genpass, pingme and pv you need to change the file location in the scripts to the location of the corresponding scripts on your pc. (You can get the python scripts in this repo)

### DISCLAIMER:
The customized git log command included in the "l.cmd" file is not made by me. All credits go to the creator: https://coderwall.com/p/euwpig/a-better-git-log
