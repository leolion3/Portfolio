# Custom Linux/MacOS Commands

Here is a list of custom commands crafted as extensions for your OS's commands. They include git shortcuts, common task shortcuts and some shortened commands.

## Installation

To install and use the commands, simply download the `install.sh` file and execute it:

### Quick Install

```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leolion3/Portfolio/master/Linux/CustomCommands/install.sh | /bin/bash
```

### Manual Install

```bash
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leolion3/Portfolio/master/Linux/CustomCommands/install.sh
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

The command executables will be placed under `~/.commands`, which you then need to add to your shell's `rc` file.
