# Youtube to MP3 Downloader

This tool allows you to simply copy a link of a youtube video to your clipboard, which will automatically start downloading that video to MP3.

It can also be used on playlists, where it will then download the entire thing.

This does require having Youtube-dl as well as ffmpeg/ffprobe/avprobe installed to funtion. Please see the python file for all the libriaries.

Please note that local regulations differ from region to region, and usage of this tool may therefor be prohibited!
