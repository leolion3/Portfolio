# Ethermine Outstanding Balance Checker

## Usage

Set the ADDRESS constant to your ethereum address, or call the method with your ethereum address.

## Requirements

This script only requires 1 module: requests_html

This is used hence the webpage needs to execute it's javascript in order to render the outstanding/current balance elements, which are not rendered when using the regular requests library.
