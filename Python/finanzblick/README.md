# Finanzblick Login API

This api has a demo script for signing into the german banking app [Finanzblick](https://finanzblickx.buhl.de/login). The demo script performs the sign-in and bearer token retrieval which can be used to access any other functions required.

The demo script currently fetches the balance of the first bank account within the retrieved list of accounts.
